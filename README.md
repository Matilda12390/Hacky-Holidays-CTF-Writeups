# Hacky-Holidays-CTF-Writeups
The writeups I made after competing in the Deloitte Hacky Holidays CTF in July 2022.
I was in the "FriedEggQuokka" student team which finished in 32nd place out of over 2000 registered teams. We finished with 3055 points and my individual total of that was 1175. I did not create a writeup for all of the challenges I completed but the ones I did are published here.
